 <br> Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra. <br>
      
     <br> First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p3> </div>

 Fire is a natural and essential<br> part of Yosemite. We manage fire<br> carefully and study how it<br> interacts with the park’s<br> ecosystems. This blog provides<br> updates about fires in Yosemite. <br>Check for <p3>current fire restrictions.</p3>
